# Poor Richard's Widget

This is the source for [Poor Richard's Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kbsriram.android.prw).

It's a small Android app - no more than a plain widget that displays a quote once a day from [Poor Richard's Almanack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Richard's_Almanack).

It also shows a historical event from that day - updated about once an hour. Tapping on the widget brings up the standard Android sharing menu; the quote and the event can then be shared with any app that accepts plain text.

Quotes from the yearly Almanacs were selected from a variety of sources including [this version from the University of Oxford](http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/desc/1579). Historical events were extracted from Wikipedia's pages for each day of the year. (Here for instance is the [data for January 15th](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?action=raw&title=January_15)). I am grateful for the generosity of both these projects in making this data freely available.

In the same spirit, the source for this app is freely available under [the Simplified BSD License](LICENSE.md).
